# Ancient-Greek-Website
The Website is intented to be a source for Ancient Greek language exploration and learning.
There are three required features are on the Home page: 1) A navegation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, switching between vertical and horizontal styles. 2) Use flexbox to organizecontent areas based on moblile or desktop views (Main and Aside areas). 3) This was not on the provided list; I created an animation feature with Javascript (Expand your mind! - circle on the Aside. I have included a fourth feature on the Contact page, which is a Contact Us form validated with Javascript.
The Home page is the one intended for evaluation. The other pages on the website are intended only as a means to test the functionality of the home page. The exception is the fourth feature mentioned above, which is in the Contact page.
