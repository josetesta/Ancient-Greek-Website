# Ancient-Greek-Website
The Website is intented to be a source for Ancient Greek language exploration and learning. The main focus is Biblical Greek.
There are three required features at the Home page: 1) A navegation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, switching between vertical and horizontal styles. 2) The use flexbox to organize content areas based on moblile or desktop views (Main and Aside areas). 3) This one was not on the provided list; I created an animation feature with Javascript (Expand your mind! - circle on the Aside). I have included a fourth feature on the Contact page, which is a Contact Us form. It has three fields validated with Javascrip. Name and Message are required fields and will return a notification if completed improperly. The Submit button will return a notification if at least Name and Message are not completed proporly.
The Home page is the one intended for evaluation. The other pages on the website are intended only as a means to test the functionality of the home page. The exception is the fourth feature mentioned above, which is in the Contact page.
